# script
Scripting language interpreter written in C++. Syntax similar to JavaScript. Obviously a just-for-fun project.

Parses script into opcodes similar to x86 assembly, then these operations are processed by a software CPU.

Designed and built with simplicity in mind rather than speed/efficiency.
